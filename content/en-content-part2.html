        <p><strong>Product:</strong> Dual-track approach. On one hand, continuously strengthening core comfort technologies like GoWalk and Slip-ins. On the other, aggressively entering professional sports, endorsing with top athletes like Harry Kane (soccer) and Joel Embiid (basketball), and launching products like professional running shoes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Channel:</strong> Major strategic adjustment in 2025, shifting from a past focus on lower-tier cities towards <strong>"returning to the original aspiration of comfort."</strong> Increasing investment in brand flagship stores in Tier 1/2 cities, upgrading store image, and strengthening family consumption scenarios.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Marketing:</strong> Marketing spend increased significantly (SG&A up 18.3% in Q1 2025), while also strengthening sponsorships like marathons. The marketing core is to bind the narrative of "comfort technology" with "professional performance."</p>

        <p><strong>Emphasis on "Value-for-Money" and "Pragmatic Growth" Culture:</strong> As a brand built on high value-for-money, its internal culture emphasizes pragmatism, efficiency, and growth, differing from cultures pursuing premium positioning and brand prestige.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Talent Profile:</strong> Prefers talent aligned with a pragmatic, growth-oriented culture, who see opportunity in the brand's strategic pivot.</p>

    <div class="module-content">
        <div class="module-title">Core Talent Trends & Nike's Critical Gaps</div>
        
        <p>Based on the brand benchmarking above, talent competition in the 2025 China market exhibits three definitive trends. These trends define the capability gaps Nike must address.</p>
        
        <h3 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin: 25px 0 15px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600;">Trend 1: Talent competition has shifted from the "Employer Brand" level down to the "Team Model" and "Manager Reputation" level.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In the past, candidates chose Nike or Adidas by choosing a major brand.</li>
            <li>Now, top talent is choosing a specific <strong>"team atmosphere," "level of empowerment," and "quality of their manager."</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Nike's Gap:</strong> The globally standardized management system may lead to insufficient innovation flexibility and decision-making authority at the front-line team level, weakening its appeal to top hands-on experts.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin: 25px 0 15px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600;">Trend 2: Shift from "Commercial Generalists" to "Vertical Specialists," with professional depth becoming hard currency.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Market growth relies on segmented tracks (running, outdoor, yoga). Brands need more than just marketing and sales talent; they need <strong>"running product experts," "outdoor community operators," "yoga category leads."</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Nike's Gap:</strong> The organization is better at cultivating and attracting "generalist" commercial leaders. It may be surpassed by focused brands like On and XTEP in terms of deep understanding and resource network accumulation in specific sports.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin: 25px 0 15px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600;">Trend 3: The key to retaining talent has expanded from compensation & benefits to "Value Alignment" and "Growth Experience."</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Anta retains talent with systemic guarantees, On retains with belief. Pure high salaries are becoming less effective in long-term competition.</li>
            <li>Talent particularly cares about: Can my work directly influence the product? Is my professional opinion respected? Can I achieve extraordinary growth alongside the business?</li>
            <li><strong>Nike's Gap:</strong> Needs to create a clearer, deliverable "impacting the globe" pathway and experience for local Chinese talent, converting brand potential into personal growth momentum.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="module-title">Layered Talent Strategy Action Plan for Nike China</div>
        
        <p>The core principle for action: <strong>Not simply imitating competitors, but designing a more attractive "way of working" targeting the deep-seated needs of desired talent.</strong></p>
        
        <h3 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin: 25px 0 15px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600;">1. Immediate Actions (Next 6 Months): Precision Countermeasures, Addressing Pain Points</h3>
        
        <h4 style="color: var(--primary-light); margin: 15px 0 10px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 600;">Establish a "Local Innovation Black Belt" Job Sequence</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Action:</strong> In core categories like running, training, and outdoor, establish "Black Belt Expert" roles independent of traditional job grades. Recruit globally with compensation benchmarked against market top levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Grant them significant influence in product definition suggestions and independent budgets for localization innovation experiments.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Directly recruit top specialists from On, HOKA, Salomon, or top-tier sports institutions to rapidly strengthen vertical depth.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 style="color: var(--primary-light); margin: 15px 0 10px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 600;">Launch the "Channel Commander" Program</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Action:</strong> Recruit hands-on experts proficient in omni-channel retail (content, livestreaming, private traffic, offline integration) from Alibaba, Douyin, Xiaohongshu, and emerging DTC brands.</li>
            <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Form cross-departmental "New Retail Strike Teams" reporting directly to China leadership, responsible for breaking through key operational links.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 style="color: var(--primary-light); margin: 15px 0 10px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 600;">Introduce a "Key Talent Retention Dialogue" Mechanism</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Action:</strong> HRBPs and business leaders must hold informal quarterly dialogues with core talent, focusing on one question: <strong>"What obstacles do we need to remove for you to achieve greater success at Nike?"</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Proactive retention, personalized resolution of talent pain points (e.g., redundant processes, insufficient empowerment).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin: 25px 0 15px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600;">2. System Building Initiatives (6-18 Months): Solidifying Foundations, Building Systems</h3>
        
        <h4 style="color: var(--primary-light); margin: 15px 0 10px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 600;">Build the "China Innovation Lab"</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> Operate as an independent Business Unit (BU) with its own product development, marketing, and financial accounting authority.</li>
            <li><strong>Mission:</strong> Focus on exploring product lines and business models serving the China market (e.g., light-functional series for urban outdoor scenarios).</li>
            <li><strong>Value:</strong> This is the ultimate "special zone" for attracting and retaining top innovative talent. It demonstrates Nike's willingness to conduct fundamental innovation for China.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 style="color: var(--primary-light); margin: 15px 0 10px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 600;">Upgrade the "Retail Leadership Accelerator"</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Benchmark:</strong> Learn from the accelerated logic of Adidas's "Retail Elite Program," but infuse it with Nike's sports DNA.</li>
            <li><strong>Design:</strong> Compress the 24-month training period into "6 months HQ rotation + 12 months in-store practical experience + 6 months leading a project."</li>
            <li><strong>Output:</strong> Aim to cultivate store managers who understand both brand and business and can lead future smart stores. This is key to countering Adidas's systematic retail talent output.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 style="color: var(--primary-light); margin: 15px 0 10px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 600;">Construct a "Category Expert Certification System"</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Design:</strong> Collaborate with global sports science teams to design professional certification courses for core China market categories like running, basketball, and soccer.</li>
            <li><strong>Mandate:</strong> Require relevant product, marketing, and sales employees to obtain corresponding category certifications as a prerequisite for promotion.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Systematically elevate the organization's professional authority in vertical fields, forming an internal knowledge barrier.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin: 25px 0 15px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600;">3. Long-Term Culture Shaping (18+ Months): Resetting Mindsets, Winning the Future</h3>
        
        <h4 style="color: var(--primary-light); margin: 15px 0 10px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 600;">Refresh the Local Employer Value Proposition (EVP): "In China, Drive Nike's Future"</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Narrative:</strong> Center all employer brand communication around "How China insights influence global products" and "How the China team leads new business models."</li>
            <li><strong>Case Studies:</strong> Annually spotlight 1-2 successful innovation cases (product, marketing, channel) led by the China team on global internal platforms.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 style="color: var(--primary-light); margin: 15px 0 10px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 600;">Implement "Global-China" Talent Exchange 2.0</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Upgrade:</strong> Evolve the existing rotation program into an exchange where <strong>"key roles back each other up."</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> China's Running Category Director could take a role in the HQ Global Running department, while the corresponding HQ expert comes to China for deep market immersion. The goal is to build deep mutual trust and consensus, truly closing the decision-making loop.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 style="color: var(--primary-light); margin: 15px 0 10px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 600;">Institutionalize Executive Team "Deep Dive" Immersion</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> China leadership team must have one "Store Day" or "Community Day" per month (with consumers, store staff, running clubs).</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Ensure top decision-makers continually sense the real market temperature, preventing strategy-execution disconnect.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="module-title">Conclusion: The Decisive Point Lies in Organizational Restructuring</div>
        
        <p>Competitors have already built unique talent attraction and retention systems around their respective strategies. Nike's advantage lies in its unparalleled brand, resources, and scale. The task now is not to dismantle competitors' systems, but to <strong>leverage its own scale to incubate one or even multiple "new organizational modules" within the China market that can rival the most appealing traits of its competitors.</strong></p>
        
        <p>The key to action is not fine-tuning HR policies, but a <strong>profound experiment in organizational empowerment.</strong> Success will first be reflected in whether, over the next 12-18 months, Nike can attract the top "mavericks" and "specialists" who previously would never have considered joining a large corporation.</p>
        
        <h3 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin: 25px 0 15px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600;">Winning the Talent War Requires an "Inside-Out" Revolution</h3>
        
        <p>The current market race no longer ends with a single product or marketing victory, but with victory in <strong>"organizational models."</strong></p>
        
        <p>Anta has proven the enduring stamina of systematic cultivation, Adidas has demonstrated the cohesive power of localized belonging, and On has illustrated the pure appeal of professional belief. For Nike, the real challenge is not poaching a few individuals from them, but whether it can undergo a profound, inside-out organizational revolution.</p>
        
        <p>The essence of this revolution is: <strong>Perfectly integrating the grand vision of a global brand with the agility, depth, and warmth required by the China market.</strong></p>
        
        <p>The proposed action plan is the beginning of this revolution. Its success will be marked by very specific signs: In the coming year, can Nike attract "mavericks" from internet platforms or niche top brands who have previously rejected large companies? Can it successfully retain the local mid-level leaders favored by competitors, who understand both business and sport?</p>
        
        <p>This is not merely an adjustment of human resources strategy, but a reshaping of strategic core capabilities. Action must begin immediately.</p>
