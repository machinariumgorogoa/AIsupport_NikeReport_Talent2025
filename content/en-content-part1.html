            <div class="module-title">Executive Summary</div>
            <p>In 2025, competition in China's sports and outdoor market has fundamentally evolved—from battles over marketing and distribution channels into a decisive confrontation over <strong>organizational capability and talent models</strong>. This report delivers an in-depth analysis of the talent strategy fundamentals of seven core competitors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ANTA</strong> has built a highly defensible and difficult-to-replicate <em>"symbiotic" talent system</em>. Through internal cultivation and deeply embedded welfare mechanisms, it has established an exceptionally stable talent foundation.</li>
                <li><strong>adidas</strong> has created an outstanding employee experience through its <em>"homecourt" culture</em> and strengthened its retail talent pipeline via accelerated development programs, thereby reinforcing its local roots.</li>
                <li><strong>LI-NING</strong> demonstrates extreme business agility, leveraging highly flexible incentive mechanisms and flat decision-making structures to attract execution-oriented, results-driven talent.</li>
                <li><strong>Emerging brands such as On</strong> are diverting top-tier <em>"product-believer"</em> innovators by appealing to pure professional conviction and ultra-flat organizational structures.</li>
                <li><strong>Xtep</strong> has vertically entrenched itself in the running category, where its ecosystem-based approach creates unique cohesion among highly specialized professionals.</li>
                <li><strong>PEAK's</strong> recent strategic adjustments reflect an efficiency-first mindset; the resulting talent mobility may generate selective recruitment opportunities in specific functional areas.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For <strong>Nike</strong>, the core challenge is clear: its globally standardized systems are increasingly insufficient when responding to local agility demands, deepening category specialization, and meeting the new expectations of talent—namely <strong>value alignment</strong> and <strong>accelerated growth</strong>.</p>
            <p>In response, this report proposes the <strong>"Pathfinder Program"</strong>, recommending that Nike immediately initiate an inside-out organizational transformation through a three-phase approach:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Establishing critical expert roles</li>
                <li>Creating innovation special zones</li>
                <li>Reframing its employer narrative</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The objective is to decisively win the talent war of the next five years.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- 模块 2: Key Conclusions -->
    <div class="module">
        <div class="module-content">
            <div class="module-title">Key Conclusions</div>
            <p>The current competitive landscape represents an ultimate contest of <strong>organizational models</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ANTA</strong> cultivates <em>"insiders"</em> through systems.</li>
                <li><strong>adidas</strong> unites <em>"strivers"</em> through culture.</li>
                <li><strong>On</strong> attracts <em>"believers"</em> through conviction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Nike must resolve the inherent paradox between <em>"global standards"</em> and <em>"local agility."</em> The answer is <strong>not</strong> simple poaching, but rather the deliberate design of a more compelling <strong>new working model</strong> for its target talent segments.</p>

            <div class="module-title">1. ANTA Group vs. Nike: Systemic Symbiosis vs. Brand Halo</div>
            <p>ANTA has built an internally generated talent system that is exceptionally difficult to replicate. Its core is not aggressive external hiring through premium compensation, but the long-cycle cultivation of backbone talent imbued with <em>"ANTA DNA"</em> over a ten-year horizon.</p>

                        <td>A <em>"symbiotic value"</em> system. Employees are regarded as long-term business partners. Through ultra-long-term investment, ANTA aligns individual career trajectories with corporate growth, creating resonance over time.</td>

            <p><strong>Core Distinction:</strong> ANTA is a <strong>system-driven ecosystem builder</strong>, while Nike is a <strong>brand-driven innovation leader</strong>. ANTA secures its talent foundation through internal cultivation and deep welfare integration; Nike attracts elite talent through global brand equity and innovation culture.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin: 25px 0 15px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600;">Market Actions & Strategic Orientation</h3>
            <p><strong>Products:</strong> ANTA executes a <em>"single focus, multi-brand, omnichannel"</em> strategy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The core brand anchors mass professional sports.</li>
                <li>FILA consolidates leadership in fashion sportswear.</li>
                <li>Arc'teryx, DESCENTE and others dominate premium professional segments. Group-level operations enable R&D and supply-chain synergies.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Channels:</strong> Omnichannel coordination with optimized offline store tiering and differentiated online brand operations. A powerful distribution system enables deep penetration across all market tiers.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Marketing:</strong> Independent brand narratives.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ANTA emphasizes <em>"Love Sports."</em></li>
                <li>FILA focuses on fashion.</li>

            <h3 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin: 25px 0 15px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600;">Organizational Structure & Decision-Making</h3>
            <p><strong>Multi-brand autonomy with strong group synergy:</strong> Each brand retains significant operational independence, while the group provides centralized strength in supply chain, retail management, and digital platforms—forming a <em>federal-style</em> advantage.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Highly institutionalized and process-driven:</strong> Standardized systems govern the entire career lifecycle—development, promotion, and welfare—ensuring operational stability.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Founder vision combined with professional management:</strong> The founding family steers strategic direction, while seasoned professional managers execute day-to-day operations, resulting in mature corporate governance.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin: 25px 0 15px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600;">Talent Strategy Core</h3>
            <p><strong>"Internal first, external selectively":</strong> Large-scale campus hiring and management trainee programs (e.g., <em>Stars Program</em>, <em>Olympic Stars Program</em>) form the backbone of talent development. External hiring is decisive but limited to scarce, high-end profiles such as luxury retail or niche-category experts.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Deep-binding through welfare architecture:</strong> The <em>36-item welfare system</em> addresses long-term life needs, building loyalty beyond monetary compensation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Talent Profile:</strong> Prefers individuals who identify with group culture, value stable growth, and demonstrate strong collaboration—<em>career partners</em> rather than short-term opportunists.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin: 25px 0 15px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600;">Employer Value Proposition (EVP)</h3>
            <p><em>"Join us as a long-term career partner—grow together, with comprehensive and lasting security."</em></p>
            
            <h3 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin: 25px 0 15px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600;">Talent Acquisition Strategy for Nike</h3>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> ANTA has cultivated a cohort of highly loyal mid-to-senior leaders fluent in complex multi-brand operations. They are deeply embedded and resistant to conventional role- or pay-based poaching.</p>
            <p><strong>Acquisition Strategy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Target:</strong> Select individuals within premium brands (e.g., Arc'teryx, DESCENTE) who possess international exposure or aspire to a broader innovation platform.</li>
                <li><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> Offer a leap from <em>operating a successful brand</em> to <em>shaping the future of global sport</em>. Leverage Nike's frontier technology initiatives and unmatched global influence to attract those who feel constrained by systemic rigidity and seek larger, more ambitious challenges.</li>
